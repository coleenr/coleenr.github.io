    <h1>Olivia Rodrigo's Guts Tour</h1>

    <h2>My Experience at the Los Angeles Concert</h2>

        <p>
           Olivia Rodrigo's GUTS world tour closed it's first leg in Los Angeles, her home town. On August 17th, I went to her concert. 
            I bought tickets a year in advance, and waited impatiently for the day to arrive. With my three other friends, Harshita, Cameron, and Miguel,
            the day finally came to see one of our favorite artists.

            This was one of the first songs she sung to open the tour. She sat on her knees in the center of the stage and poured her heart out to all
            of her biggest supporters.

            This song, "Obsessed" is a song I truly am obsessed with. When it was first teased, I was listening to it on repeat, until she finally
            released it on her deluxe version of the album. The visuals for the song and hardcore bass made it feel so surreal to be in that moment, 
            singing that song.
